<h3>Things that are not in Kotlin that I don't miss</h3>

Everything that you can do with Java you can do it with Kotlin too.
However, some of the features that you can still find in Java are there just because Java it is backward compatible.
That means that you can still run a program in coded in Java 1 with Java 8, but also means that for instance you cannot remove the ";"
from the language and make it more flexible.

Here a few examples of things that you cannot find in Kotlin and I don't miss:
<ul>
    <li>Checked Exceptions: In my opinion checked exceptions are not useful, make the code more verbose, less readable
        (result in multiple throws clause declarations) and are not compatible with functional coding.
    </li>
    <li>Primitive types: Kotlin has primitives too (the same as Java) but they are not a special case. In Kotlin,
        everything is an object, including basic types.
    </li>
    <li>Static members: Kotlin has replaced this with package-level (also called top-level) functions and companion
        objects. In most cases it is recommended to use package-level functions, which are functions declared outside of
        any class, so there is no need for extra level of nesting.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Features that are in Kotlin and I miss in Java</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Functions with default and named parameters: In Kotlin you could define a function with default parameters. This
        way you can call a function and only specify the parameters which are different to the default ones:
    </li>
    [java]
    fun defaultSum(p1: Int, p2: Int = 10, p3: Int = 0): Int {
    return p1 + p2 + p3
    }

    assert(3 == defaultSum(1, 2))
    assert(13 == defaultSum(3))
    assert(15 == defaultSum(3, p3 = 2))

    [/java]
    <li>Extension functions: Itâ€™s a function that can be called as a member of a class but is defined outside of it.
        This feature makes it easier to integrate with existing code. For instance, in Kotlin you could add a new
        function to the Java String class and use it in your code.
    </li>
    <li>Operator overloading: Similar to other languages Kotlin allows you to overload operators. For instance, you
        could define a special method plus to overload the + operator.
    </li>
    <li>Null-safety: In Kotlin, the compiler will be in charge of checking any possible NullPointerException.</li>
    <li>Smart casts: When you check if an object conforms to a given type, then the compiler already know the type of
        the object. Therefore you don't need to cast it. Let's have a look to an example:
    </li>
        [code]
        if (x !is String){
            print(x.length) //there is no need to cast it
        }
        [/code]

    <li>Singletons: It is possible to build singletons with Java, but Kotlin provides first class support for creating
        singletons. You just need to use the word "object".
    </li>
    <li>Range expressions: Kotlin makes it easier to define a range by using the .. operator (ex: for (i in 1..4) ).
        Other keywords like downTo (for reversing the order), step and until could also be very useful.
    </li>
    <li>Data classes: If you mark a class as "data", then the compiler automatically generates the following methods from all
        properties declared in the primary constructor: toString, equals, hashCode and copy.
    </li>
    <li>String-handling functions: Kotlin provides an extra number of functions and templates that makes it easier to
        work with Strings.
    </li>
    <li>Destructuring Declarations: This feature allows you to unpack a single composite value and use it to initialize
        several separate variables.
        For instance: you can destruct an object and assign it to 2 variables: val (x,y) = Point(10, 20)
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> In my opinion Kotlin doesn't have a single feature which will blow your mind, but when you put all of them together
    it really makes a difference. Kotlin removes a lot of the boilerplate code that you have in Java and let
    you spend more time in the interesting parts of the code and less on routine matters.

    Kotlin is not just object-oriented but also functional too.
    A functional style provides conciseness, safe multi-threading and easier testing.
    Most of the most popular features of functional languages are available in Kotlin like first-class functions and
    immutability.
    Since Java 8 you can use the functional style too in Java but Kotlin provides the syntactic and library support required to
    use it effortlessly.

    The fact that Kotlin is full compatible with Java is also one of its biggest strength.
    Existing Java code can be called from Kotlin in a natural way, and Kotlin code can be used from Java too.
    This gives you the flexibility of mixing Java and Kotlin anywhere in your project. I personally, wouldn't
    recommend mixing them, at least not in production code. However, you could introduce it for testing.
    Currently, there are very good frameworks which offer a more expressive DSL for writing tests in Kotlin like KotlinTest and Spek.

    One field where Java is clearly much better than Kotlin is in the amount of available resources.
    Java is more than 20 years old and the amount of books, articles, posts... available is innumerable.
    The Kotlin community it is growing very fast, but still has a long path until it reaches the same community as Java has.

    In conclusion, Kotlin is a great language with lots of fantastic features that makes coding much pleasant and improves the quality and readability  of the code.
    Saying that my personal recommendation is that if you already working on a Java project I wouldn't recommend to mix languages.
    On the other hand, if you are planning to start a new project or a new microservice then I will definitely recommend to use Kotlin.
