<h3>Things that are not in Kotlin that I don't miss</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Checked Exceptions: In my opinion checked exceptions are not useful, make the code more verbose, less readable
        (result in multiple throws clause declarations) and are not compatible with functional coding.
    </li>
    <li>Primitive types: Kotlin has primitives (the same as Java) but they are not a special case, they are objects as
        all the other types.
    </li>
    <li>Static members: Kotlin has replaced this with package-level (also called top-level) functions and companion
        objects. In most cases it is recommended to use package-level functions, which are functions declared outside of
        any class, so there is no need for extra level of nesting.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Things that are in Kotlin and I miss in Java</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Functions with default and named parameters: In Kotlin you could define a function with default parameters. This
        way you can the call a function and only specify the parameters which are different to the default ones
    </li>
    [java]
    fun defaultSum(p1: Int, p2: Int = 10, p3: Int = 0): Int {
    return p1 + p2 + p3
    }

    assert(3 == defaultSum(1, 2))
    assert(13 == defaultSum(3))
    assert(15 == defaultSum(3, p3 = 2))

    [/java]
    <li>Extension functions: Itâ€™s a function that can be called as a member of a class but is defined outside of it.
        This feature makes it easier to integrate with existing code. For instance, in Kotlin you could add a new
        function to the Java String class and use it in your code.
    </li>
    <li>Operator overloading: Similar to other languages Kotlin allows you to overload operators. For instance, you
        could define a special method plus to overload the + operator.
    </li>
    <li>Null-safety: In Kotlin, the compiler will be in charge of checking any possible NullPointerException.</li>
    <li>Smart casts: When you check if an object conforms to a given type, then the compiler already know the type of
        the object and there is no need to cast.Let's have a look to an example:
        [code]
        if (x !is String){
        print(x.length) //there is no need to cast
        }
        [/code]
    </li>
    <li>Singletons: It is possible to build singletons with Java, but Kotlin provides first class support for creating
        singletons. Just need to use the word "object".
    </li>
    <li>Range expressions: Kotlin makes it easier to define a range by providing the .. operator ( for (i in 1..4) ).
        Other keywords like downTo (for reversing the order), step and until could be very useful.
    </li>
    <li>Data classes: If you mark a class a data, then the compiler automatically derives the following members from all
        properties declared in the primary constructor: toString, equals, hashCode and copy
    </li>
    <li>String-handling functions: Kotlin provides an extra number of functions and templates that makes it easier to
        work with Strings
    </li>
    <li>Destructuring Declarations: This feature allows you to unpack a single composite value and use it to initialize
        several separate variables.
        For instance: you can destructure an object and assign it to 2 variables: val (x,y) = Point(10, 20)
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> In my opinion Kotlin doesn't have a single feature which will blow your mind, but when you put all of them together
    it really makes a difference. Kotlin removes a lot of the boilerplate code that you have in Java and let
    you spend more time in the interesting parts of the code and less on routine matters.

    Kotlin provides a nice syntactic sugar similar to Groovy, but the fact that it is a statically typed language and the
    type of every expression is calculated at compile time. (performance, reliability, maintainability)

    Kotlin is not just object-oriented but also functional too.
    Most of the most popular features of functional languages are available in Kotlin like first-class functions,
    immutability and no side effects. A functional style provides conciseness, safe multithreading and easier testing.
    Since Java 8 you can use the functional style too in Java but Kotlin provides the syntactic and library support required to
    use it effortlessly.

    The fact that Kotlin is full compatible with Java is also one of its biggest strength.
    You could use it with you current Java libraries and at the same time any Java application could call your Kotlin
    libraries.
    This gives you the flexibility in mixing Java and Kotlin anywhere in your project. I personally, wouldn't
    recommend mixing them, but in an existing Java project you could use it for testing.
    Currently, there are very good frameworks which offer a more expressive DSL for writing tests in Kotlin like KotlinTest and Spek.

    One field where Java is clearly much better than Kotlin is in the amount of available resources.
    Java is more than 20 years old and the amount of books, articles, posts... available is innumerable.
    When I try to find an answer for a Java question online I usually can find the solution very quickly while in Kotlin
    could take me a bit longer.
    Although Kotlin is growing very fast, still has a long path until it reaches the same community as Java has.

    In conclusion, Kotlin is a great language with lots of fantastic features that makes coding much pleasant and improves the quality of the code.
    Saying that my personal recommendation is that if you already working on a Java project I wouldn't recommend to mix languages.
    On the other hand, if you are planning to start a new project or a new microservice then I will definetly recomment to use Kotlin.
