<h3>Things that are not in Kotlin that I don't miss</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Checked Exceptions: In my opinion checked exceptions are not useful, make the code more verbose, less readable (result in multiple throws clause declarations) and are not compatible with functional coding.</li>
    <li>Primitive types: Kotlin has primitives (the same as Java) but they are not a special case, they are objects as all the other types.</li>
    <li>Static members: Kotlin has replaced this with package-level (also called top-level) functions and companion objects. In most cases it is recommended to use package-level functions, which are functions declared outside of any class, so there is no need for extra level of nesting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Things that are in Kotlin and I miss in Java</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Functions with default and named parameters: In Kotlin you could define a function with default parameters. This way you can the call a function and only specify the parameters which are different to the default ones</li>
    [java]
    fun defaultSum(p1: Int, p2: Int = 10, p3: Int = 0): Int {
        return p1 + p2 + p3
    }

    assert(3 == defaultSum(1, 2))
    assert(13 == defaultSum(3))
    assert(15 == defaultSum(3, p3 = 2))

    [/java]
    <li>Extension functions: Itâ€™s a function that can be called as a member of a class but is defined outside of it. This feature makes it easier to integrate with existing code. For instance, in Kotlin you could add a new function to the Java String class and use it in your code.</li>
    <li>Operator overloading: Similar to other languages Kotlin allows you to overload operators. For instance, you could define a special method plus to overload the + operator. </li>
    <li>Null-safety: In Kotlin, the compiler will be in charge of checking any possible NullPointerException.</li>
    <li>Smart casts: When you check if an </li>

</ul>
